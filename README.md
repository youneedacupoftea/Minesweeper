# Minesweeper
An object-oriented programming project that implements the Minesweeper game using Qt.
## 1. Requirements Analysis

(1) Minefield Generation: Beginner, intermediate, and advanced difficulty levels.

(2) User Interaction: Displaying the number of remaining mines, marking a mine, and triggering a minefield explosion. A timer should start on the first click and stop when the game ends. 

(3) Game Logic: Handle the criteria for winning and losing the game. 

(4) Timing and Counting: Implement a game timer and counter function.

(5) User Interface: It should include a menu bar, a game area, and a status bar. 

(6) Other Functions: Game restart and difficulty switching. Minefields are randomly generated each time the game starts.
